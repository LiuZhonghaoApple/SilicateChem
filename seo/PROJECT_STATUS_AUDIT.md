# SilicateChem — Project Status Audit

**Date:** 2026-06-18  
**Scope:** SEO RFQ acquisition system — codebase scan (read-only audit)  
**Domain:** https://silicatechem.com  
**Authority sink:** `/products/sodium-metasilicate`

---

## Executive Summary

The **SEO RFQ system architecture is implemented** across four funnel layers (money pages → applications → guides → blog). Conversion components (RFQ form, sticky bar, floating widget, contextual pre-fill) are in place. Trust layer components are integrated on key pages. **Launch blockers remain:** real images, production email delivery, analytics/CRM lead tracking, certified MSDS, and local production build verification.
